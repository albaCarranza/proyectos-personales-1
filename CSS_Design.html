            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>One-to-one communication skills are essential in almost all professions. Most professionals need to
                appropriately communicate with clients. Many university and vocational programs require communication
                skills, and train their students in communication skills.</p>

            <div class="block-box">
                <blockquote>
                    "Communication skills are best learned through practice"
                </blockquote>
            </div>

            <p>Learning environments for training one-to-one communication skills offer scenarios that typically occur
                in real-world situations. A scenario consists of a setting, and a sequence of usually alternating
                statements between a student and a virtual character. A bad news conversation for a doctor typically
                involves a diagnosis of a terrible illness, for a manager firing an employee. Although these bad news
                conversations in different situations follow a similar pattern, the subtleties of a conversation and the
                responses are very different.</p>


            <p>At an abstract level, we can compare scenarios along several axes:</p>

            <div class="scenario">
                <ul>
                    <li>Does the scenario follow a predefined structure or not?</li>
                    <li>What aspects of a virtual character can be controlled by a scenario: utterances, emotions,
                        gestures, …?</li>
                    <li>Are both the choices for a student and the responses from a virtual character completely
                        scripted, or are some of these aspects generated by means of some AI technique?</li>
                    <li>Is it possible to define or use learning goals, and score interactions from a student on these
                        goals?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

            <h2>Learning Environments for Communication Skills</h2>
            <p>Vogel et al. define a game as software that has a goal, is interactive, and is rewarding (gives
                feedback). Interactive simulation activities must interact with a user by offering options to choose or
                define parameters of a simulation. A user then plays a newly created simulation rather than simply
                selecting a pre-recorded simulation.</p>
            <p>The top-level characteristic for learning environments for communication skills is whether or not, or to
                what extent, scenarios are scripted. According to <strong>realdon</strong>, scripting different ad hoc
                perspectives is a fundamental prerequisite for a narrative structure in order to reproduce both the
                flexibility and regularity of communicative exchanges. In Face-to-Face Interaction with Pedagogical
                Agents, Twenty Years Later <strong>Johnson</strong> and <strong>Lester</strong> evaluate the evolution
                of features of pedagogical agents over two decades.</p>
            <p>Learning environments for communication skills are used in very different contexts, and collecting the
                available (descriptions of) environments is non-trivial. We searched for papers on learning environments
                for communication skills on Scopus by looking at the title, abstract, and keywords using a query and
                refined the query stepwise.</p>
            <p>The final search query is:</p>

            <h2>Characteristics of Scenarios</h2>

            <p>The majority of the papers in the literature describe a communication exchange between a player and a
                virtual character as a tree, graph or chart. Communication flows from a virtual character to a player
                and vice-versa.</p>
            <p>A dialogue proceeds from one statement to another between characters (player and virtual) and flows
                forward. Such a communication exchange can be represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG).</p>

            <div class="block-box">
                <blockquote>
                    "A DAG consists of a finite set of nodes and edges between nodes, with no cycles."
                </blockquote>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Bosse</strong> et al. present a game for aggression de-escalation training with a scenario
                simulation in a public transport tram. <strong>Bracegirdle</strong> et al. present simulations in
                clinical communication skills which play in a hospital and a clinic respectively.</p>
            <p>In interactive narratives a user may read subjects in a hierarchy without any predefined order. To
                overcome predictable behaviour in a conversation with an agent, agents in conversational trees are
                endowed with an internal state to introduce variability in statements. In Communicate!
                <strong>Jeuring</strong> et al. interleaving enhances expressiveness in a communication scenario by
                allowing students to navigate a conversation with a virtual character through subjects.</p>
